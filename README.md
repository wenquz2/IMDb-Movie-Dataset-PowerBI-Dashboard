The Dashboard consists of:

1)A vertically stacked bar chart to show the number of good movies(movies with a rating of 6.0 or higher), by the year when they were released.

2)A line chart showing the total revenue(in millions) of the movies by year.

3)A donut chart showing the great moviews by their rating and titles. To become a great movie, it must have a rating of 8.0 or higher.

4)A treemap showing movie directors and the highest rating on the films they directed. The top left corner has the director with the highest rated movie, and the highest rating decrease when going down and right of the tree map.
